# K-Means Clustering for Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates the application of the K-Means clustering algorithm on the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning. The goal is to group similar data points based on their features without prior knowledge of the labels, showcasing the effectiveness of unsupervised learning techniques.

## Overview

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers:

- **Iris-setosa**
- **Iris-versicolor**
- **Iris-virginica**

Each sample has four features:

- **Sepal Length**: Length of the sepal.
- **Sepal Width**: Width of the sepal.
- **Petal Length**: Length of the petal.
- **Petal Width**: Width of the petal.

The K-Means algorithm partitions the dataset into K clusters by minimizing the within-cluster variance. The number of clusters (K) is a parameter that needs to be specified beforehand.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files:

- `k-means-clustering-for-iris-dataset.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that performs the following tasks:
  - Loads the Iris dataset.
  - Determines the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
  - Applies the K-Means algorithm to cluster the data.
  - Visualizes the clusters and their centroids.
- `Iris.csv`: The dataset file containing the Iris flower data.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dattatejaofficial/K-Means-Clustering-for-Iris-Dataset.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Move into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd K-Means-Clustering-for-Iris-Dataset
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended): Set up a virtual environment to manage project dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python packages using pip. The necessary packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. If `requirements.txt` is not present, you can manually install the following packages:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## Usage

To run the analysis:

1. **Ensure the Virtual Environment is Activated**: Make sure your virtual environment is active (refer to the setup instructions above).

2. **Run the Notebook**: Open `k-means-clustering-for-iris-dataset.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface and execute the cells sequentially to perform the analysis and visualize the results.

## Extracted Insights

The application of the K-Means clustering algorithm to the Iris dataset yielded the following insights:

- **Optimal Number of Clusters**: The Elbow Method indicated that three clusters are optimal for this dataset, corresponding to the three Iris species.

- **Cluster Characteristics**: Each cluster represents a group of data points with similar feature values. Visualizing the clusters helps in understanding the distribution and separation of different species based on their features.

- **Centroid Positions**: The centroids of the clusters provide insight into the average feature values of the data points within each cluster, aiding in distinguishing between the species.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python packages:

- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

These dependencies are essential for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization tasks.
